TOOLING:
make a list of 100 sudoku read from files to be used in test suite

performance tests for a number of different solving strategies/implementations
- ordered most performant to least performant across ~100 sudoku puzzles


FEATURES:

Builder pattern for sudoku? or just reading from a file might be easier, could do withCell() and withRow but cannot combine them
- this should work smoothly with creation of either type of sudoku, withType(Type.CELL) withType(Type.Integer)

abstract builder pattern CellSudokuBuilder and IntegerSudokuBuilder? something to easily swap between Integer and Cell types

write basic sudoku solving strategies

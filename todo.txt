TOOLING:
make a list of 100 sudoku read from files to be used in test suite

performance tests for a number of different solving strategies/implementations
- ordered most performant to least performant across ~100 sudoku puzzles

accuracy tests for re-ordering the LoopingSolver to make sure it never adds incorrect information
- apply to the same suite of all sudoku

FEATURES:

strategies to add:
subsets (2 cells with equal subsets of 2 numbers in the same row/col/box will remove options of those 2 values in that row/col/box)
- applies to 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 (nine might be possible but we can probably stop checking at 5, make it a variable)

interaction
- if a row/col has a certain option only available in a single box then the cells outside of that row/col but inside the box can have the option removed for that number
- the same applies if the only place for a number within a box falls on the same row/col then the rest of that row/col can remove the number from their options

Refactoring:
Scanning can be refactored into
  - for each cell in the board, cross out rows, cols, and boxes for a given (row, col)
